    "### Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaraunt near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaraunt? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a sunbsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaraunt? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’.  There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under \\\\$20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants (\\\\$20 - \\\\$50). "

    "4. CarryAway\n",

    "### Car\n",
    "The following values are included for <b>car</b>:\n",
    "1. Scooter and motorcycle                    22\n",
    "2. Mazda5                                        22\n",

    "The only relevant information from this column are values that have <b>\"do not drive\"</b>. As this is study is meant to focus on coupons for people that drive, these rows should be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, given that the this column is so sparesley populated it likely would be better to just drop it entirely as no data could be considered statistically relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Times Going to X\n",

    "- Bar\n",
    "- CoffeeHouse\n",
    "- CarryAway\n",
    "- RestaurantLessThan20\n",
    "- Restaurant20To50\n",

    "For any <code>NaN</code> values, we will make the assumtion that these means the user never goes to these locations and as such will replace the value with <b>\"never\"</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may potentially skew the data incorrectly towards <b>\"never\"</b> values. However, the missing values for the given columns are relatively small, about 100 or so per column (out of 12684 rows), so this should not contribute to the data in a significant way. Still, it would be a good idea to keep this in mind when examining trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HasChildren\n",
    "While data indicates whether or a user does or does not have children (0/1), the User attributes information indicated that data would indicate how many children a user has (0/1/2+). This is not the case and should be reported as missing data.\n",

    "<b>\"passanger\"</b> is misspelled incorrectly, should be renamed to <b>\"passenger\"</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age\n",
    "<b>\"age\"</b> represents an age range, which is unclear from the values. Data should updated to make that more (eg. \"21-25\", \"26-30\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Times Going to X\n",
    "For each column indicating the number of times a user goes to a given type of location, no time unit is specified (eg. \"per week\", \"per month\"). For the purposes of this analysis we will assume that all columns use the same time period, but a proper analysis would require confirming this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ToCoupon\n",
    "<b>\"toCoupon_*\"</b> represents time between destination and venue, with a <b>\"greater than or equal to\"</b> value. All three columns should be merged into one column, <b>\"toCoupon(min)\"</b> with values <b>\"5-14\"</b>, <b>\"15-24\"</b>, or <b>\"25+\"</b> for more effective analysis.\n",
